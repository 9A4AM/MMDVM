This is the source code of the MMDVM firmware that supports D-Star, DMR, System Fusion and P25.

It runs on the Arduino Due and the ST-Micro STM32F4xx platforms. Support for the Teensy (3.1/3.2 and 3.5/3.6) is being added.

In order to build this software for the Arduino Due, you will need to edit a file within the Arduino GUI and that is detailed in the BUILD.txt file. The STM32 support is being supplied via the Coocox IDE with ARM GCC. The Teensy support is via the latest beta of Teensyduino.

This software is licenced under the GPL v2 and is intended for amateur and educational use only. Use of this software for commercial purposes is strictly forbidden.
